## 📊 Data Source

The dataset used in this project was sourced from **Kaggle**. It contains synthetic healthcare records, including:

* **Patient Demographics:** Age, gender, and insurance details.
* **Clinical Visits:** Appointment history across multiple branches.
* **Financial Transactions:** Billing amounts, payment statuses, and treatment costs.

This data provides a realistic foundation for performing complex **SQL joins** and generating actionable **business intelligence**.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive SQL analysis of a hospital
database, covering patient behavior, clinical operations, treatment
patterns, and financial performance.

The analysis was designed to simulate real-world healthcare analytics
tasks — the type of work performed by Medical Data Analysts at
hospitals, NGOs, and health-tech organizations.
